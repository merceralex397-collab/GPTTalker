## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The validated finding `EXEC-REMED-001` no longer reproduces.
- [ ] Current quality checks rerun with evidence tied to the fix approach: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.
