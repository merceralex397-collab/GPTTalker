# Live Repo Repair Plan

## Preconditions

- Repo: /home/pc/projects/GPTTalker
- Audit stayed non-mutating. No repo or product-code edits were made by this diagnosis run.

## Triage Order

- package_first_count: 0
- subject_repo_follow_up_count: 2
- host_or_manual_prerequisite_count: 0

## Package Changes Required First

- None recorded.

## Post-Update Repair Actions

- Route 2 workflow-layer finding(s) into `scafforge-repair` for deterministic managed-surface refresh.

### REMED-003

- linked_report_id: WFLOW010
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Regenerate `START-HERE.md`, `.opencode/state/context-snapshot.md`, and `.opencode/state/latest-handoff.md` from canonical manifest, workflow state, and pivot state after every workflow save, compute handoff readiness from bootstrap plus repair-follow-on plus verification state in one shared contract, and fail repair verification if any derived restart surface drifts.

### REMED-004

- linked_report_id: WFLOW008
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Keep `pending_process_verification` visible, route the backlog verifier across the affected done-ticket set, expose `ticket_reverify` as the legal trust-restoration path, and when that affected set is empty leave a direct legal clear path for `pending_process_verification = false` instead of implying the repo is already clean or leaving the flag stranded.

## Ticket Follow-Up

### REMED-001

- linked_report_id: EXEC001
- action_type: generated-repo remediation ticket/process repair
- should_scafforge_repair_run: only after managed workflow repair converges
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Verify every import succeeds: `python -c 'from src.<pkg>.main import app'`. Use string annotations (`-> "TypeName"`) for TYPE_CHECKING-only imports. Use `request: Request` (not `app: FastAPI`) in FastAPI dependency functions.
- assignee: implementer
- suggested_fix_approach: Verify every import succeeds: `python -c 'from src.<pkg>.main import app'`. Use string annotations (`-> "TypeName"`) for TYPE_CHECKING-only imports. Use `request: Request` (not `app: FastAPI`) in FastAPI dependency functions.

### REMED-002

- linked_report_id: REF-003
- action_type: generated-repo remediation ticket/process repair
- should_scafforge_repair_run: only after managed workflow repair converges
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Audit local relative import paths and fail when the referenced module file is missing.
- assignee: implementer
- suggested_fix_approach: Audit local relative import paths and fail when the referenced module file is missing.

## Reverification Plan

- After package-side fixes land, run one fresh audit on the subject repo before applying another repair cycle.
- After managed repair, rerun the public repair verifier and confirm restart surfaces, ticket routing, and any historical trust restoration paths match the current canonical state.
- Do not treat restart prose alone as proof; the canonical manifest and workflow state remain the source of truth.
