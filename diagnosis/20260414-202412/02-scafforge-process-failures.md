## Root Cause Analysis

### EXEC-REMED-001

- root_cause: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- safer_target_pattern: For remediation tickets with `finding_source`, require the review artifact to record the exact command run, include raw command output, and state the explicit PASS/FAIL result before the review counts as trustworthy closure.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.

### WFLOW023

- root_cause: Transition guidance and transition enforcement must inspect artifact verdicts, not just artifact existence. Otherwise weaker models continue on the happy path after blocker findings.
- safer_target_pattern: Extract verdicts from the latest review and QA artifacts, route FAIL or BLOCKED outcomes back to implementation, and reject lifecycle transitions when the latest artifact verdict is blocking or unclear.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: The generated lifecycle contract is not verdict-aware, so FAIL review or QA artifacts can still look advanceable.

### WFLOW026

- root_cause: The repo-local workflow parser does not cover the real artifact verdict forms already present in downstream review and QA artifacts, including markdown-emphasized labels, compact stage headings such as `## QA PASS`, and plain `**Overall**: PASS` labels. Those explicit verdicts then look unparseable and block review or QA transitions even though the artifact body is clear.
- safer_target_pattern: Keep one shared artifact verdict extractor that accepts the real artifact family in use: plain and markdown-emphasized verdict labels, compact `QA/Review + verdict` headings, and `Overall: PASS/FAIL` labels. Route ticket_lookup and ticket_update through that shared parser instead of treating explicit review or QA verdicts as unclear.
- how_the_workflow_allowed_it: Current artifacts contain explicit verdict headings or labels, but the generated verdict extractor still reports them as unclear.
