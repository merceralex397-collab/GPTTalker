# Live Repo Repair Plan

## Preconditions

- Repo: /home/rowan/GPTTalker
- Audit stayed non-mutating. No repo or product-code edits were made by this diagnosis run.

## Triage Order

- package_first_count: 0
- subject_repo_follow_up_count: 10
- host_or_manual_prerequisite_count: 0

## Package Changes Required First

- None recorded.

## Post-Update Repair Actions

- Route 2 workflow-layer finding(s) into `scafforge-repair` for deterministic managed-surface refresh.

### REMED-028

- linked_report_id: WFLOW023
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Extract verdicts from the latest review and QA artifacts, route FAIL or BLOCKED outcomes back to implementation, and reject lifecycle transitions when the latest artifact verdict is blocking or unclear.

### REMED-029

- linked_report_id: WFLOW026
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Keep one shared artifact verdict extractor that accepts the real artifact family in use: plain and markdown-emphasized verdict labels, compact `QA/Review + verdict` headings, and `Overall: PASS/FAIL` labels. Route ticket_lookup and ticket_update through that shared parser instead of treating explicit review or QA verdicts as unclear.

## Ticket Follow-Up

### REMED-018

## Reverification Plan

- After package-side fixes land, run one fresh audit on the subject repo before applying another repair cycle.
- After managed repair, rerun the public repair verifier and confirm restart surfaces, ticket routing, and any historical trust restoration paths match the current canonical state.
- Do not treat restart prose alone as proof; the canonical manifest and workflow state remain the source of truth.
