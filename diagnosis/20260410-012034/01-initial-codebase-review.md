# Initial Codebase Review

## Scope

- subject repo: /home/pc/projects/GPTTalker
- diagnosis timestamp: 2026-04-10T01:20:34Z
- audit scope: managed workflow, restart, ticket, prompt, and execution surfaces
- verification scope: current repo state only

## Result State

- result_state: validated failures found
- finding_count: 3
- errors: 2
- warnings: 1

## Validated Findings

### Workflow Findings

### CYCLE002

- finding_id: CYCLE002
- summary: Repeated diagnosis packs are re-reporting the same repair-routed findings without any intervening package or process-version change.
- severity: error
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: diagnosis/20260410-005026/manifest.json, .opencode/meta/bootstrap-provenance.json
- observed_or_reproduced: Audit kept producing new diagnosis packs even though the repo had no later Scafforge repair or workflow-contract change after the latest diagnosis. That creates audit churn instead of new decision-making evidence.
- evidence:
  - Same-day diagnosis packs considered: 3 on 2026-04-10
  - Latest diagnosis pack without later repair: diagnosis/20260410-005026
  - Current audit package commit: d82df7b2b0550e2378b02b10809153089e0eadd9
  - Repeated repair-routed findings: SKILL001
  - Compared packs: diagnosis/20260410-005000, diagnosis/20260410-005026
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

### SKILL001

- finding_id: SKILL001
- summary: One or more repo-local skills still contain generic placeholder text instead of project-specific guidance.
- severity: warning
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md
- observed_or_reproduced: project-skill-bootstrap or later managed-surface repair left baseline local skills in a scaffold placeholder state, so agents lose concrete stack and validation guidance.
- evidence:
  - .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md -> When the repo stack is finalized, rewrite this catalog so review and QA agents get the exact build, lint, reference-integrity, and test commands that belong to this project.
  - .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md -> - When the project stack is confirmed, replace this file's Universal Standards section with stack-specific rules using the `project-skill-bootstrap` skill.
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

## Code Quality Findings

### EXEC-REMED-001

- finding_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- summary: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/artifacts/history/fix-020/review/2026-04-09T23-50-03-631Z-review.md
- observed_or_reproduced: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- evidence:
  - ticket FIX-020 carries finding_source `code-review`
  - review artifact: .opencode/state/artifacts/history/fix-020/review/2026-04-09T23-50-03-631Z-review.md
  - missing exact command record
  - missing raw command output section with non-empty code block
  - missing explicit post-fix PASS/FAIL result

## Verification Gaps

- The diagnosis pack validates the concrete failures above. It does not claim broader runtime-path coverage than the current audit and supporting evidence actually exercised.
