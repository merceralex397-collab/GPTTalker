# Initial Codebase Review

## Scope

- subject repo: /home/pc/projects/GPTTalker
- diagnosis timestamp: 2026-04-10T02:49:43Z
- audit scope: managed workflow, restart, ticket, prompt, and execution surfaces
- verification scope: current repo state only

## Result State

- result_state: validated failures found
- finding_count: 3
- errors: 2
- warnings: 1

## Validated Findings

### Workflow Findings

### SKILL001

- finding_id: SKILL001
- summary: One or more repo-local skills still contain generic placeholder text instead of project-specific guidance.
- severity: warning
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md
- observed_or_reproduced: project-skill-bootstrap or later managed-surface repair left baseline local skills in a scaffold placeholder state, so agents lose concrete stack and validation guidance.
- evidence:
  - .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md -> When the repo stack is finalized, rewrite this catalog so review and QA agents get the exact build, lint, reference-integrity, and test commands that belong to this project.
  - .opencode/skills/stack-standards/SKILL.md -> - When the project stack is confirmed, replace this file's Universal Standards section with stack-specific rules using the `project-skill-bootstrap` skill.
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

## Code Quality Findings

### EXEC-REMED-001

- finding_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- summary: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/artifacts/history/fix-020/review/2026-04-09T23-50-03-631Z-review.md
- observed_or_reproduced: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- evidence:
  - ticket FIX-020 carries finding_source `code-review`
  - review artifact: .opencode/state/artifacts/history/fix-020/review/2026-04-09T23-50-03-631Z-review.md
  - missing exact command record
  - missing raw command output section with non-empty code block
  - missing explicit post-fix PASS/FAIL result

### EXEC001

- finding_id: EXEC001
- summary: One or more Python packages fail to import — the service cannot start.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: /tmp/scafforge-repair-candidate-rskkis9n/candidate/src
- observed_or_reproduced: Runtime errors (NameError, FastAPIError, missing dependency, broken DI pattern, etc.) that are invisible to static analysis prevent module load. Common causes: TYPE_CHECKING-guarded names used in runtime annotations, FastAPI dependency functions with non-Pydantic parameter types, circular imports.
- evidence:
  - src.hub: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiosqlite'
  - src.node_agent: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'
  - src.shared: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiosqlite'

## Verification Gaps

- The diagnosis pack validates the concrete failures above. It does not claim broader runtime-path coverage than the current audit and supporting evidence actually exercised.
