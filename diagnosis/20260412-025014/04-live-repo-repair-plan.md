# Live Repo Repair Plan

## Preconditions

- Repo: /home/pc/projects/GPTTalker
- Audit stayed non-mutating. No repo or product-code edits were made by this diagnosis run.

## Triage Order

- package_first_count: 0
- subject_repo_follow_up_count: 9
- host_or_manual_prerequisite_count: 0

## Package Changes Required First

- None recorded.

## Post-Update Repair Actions

- Route 1 workflow-layer finding(s) into `scafforge-repair` for deterministic managed-surface refresh.

- After deterministic repair, rerun project-local skill regeneration, agent-team follow-up, and prompt hardening before handoff.

### REMED-018

- linked_report_id: SKILL001
- action_type: safe Scafforge package change
- should_scafforge_repair_run: yes
- carry_diagnosis_pack_into_scafforge_first: no
- target_repo: subject repo
- summary: Populate every required repo-local skill with concrete current rules and validation commands; generated `.opencode/skills/` files must not retain template filler or stale synthesized workflow guidance.

## Reverification Plan

- After package-side fixes land, run one fresh audit on the subject repo before applying another repair cycle.
- After managed repair, rerun the public repair verifier and confirm restart surfaces, ticket routing, and any historical trust restoration paths match the current canonical state.
- Do not treat restart prose alone as proof; the canonical manifest and workflow state remain the source of truth.
