- errors: 3
- warnings: 1

## Validated Findings

### Workflow Findings

### WFLOW010

- finding_id: WFLOW010
- summary: Derived restart surfaces disagree with canonical workflow state, so resume guidance can route work from stale or contradictory facts.
- severity: error
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/workflow-state.json, .opencode/meta/pivot-state.json, START-HERE.md, .opencode/state/context-snapshot.md, .opencode/state/latest-handoff.md
- observed_or_reproduced: `START-HERE.md`, `.opencode/state/context-snapshot.md`, and `.opencode/state/latest-handoff.md` are not being regenerated from `tickets/manifest.json`, `.opencode/state/workflow-state.json`, and `.opencode/meta/pivot-state.json` after workflow mutations or managed repair, leaving bootstrap, repair-follow-on, pivot, verification, lane-lease, or active-ticket state stale.
- evidence:
  - START-HERE.md ticket_id drift: expected 'EXEC-011' from canonical state, found None.
  - START-HERE.md stage drift: expected 'closeout' from canonical state, found None.
  - START-HERE.md status drift: expected 'done' from canonical state, found None.
  - START-HERE.md handoff_status drift: expected 'repair follow-up required' from canonical state, found None.
  - START-HERE.md bootstrap_status drift: expected 'ready' from canonical state, found None.
  - START-HERE.md bootstrap_proof drift: expected '.opencode/state/artifacts/history/exec-011/bootstrap/2026-03-28T16-33-16-169Z-environment-bootstrap.md' from canonical state, found None.
  - START-HERE.md pending_process_verification drift: expected 'true' from canonical state, found None.
  - START-HERE.md pivot_in_progress drift: expected 'false' from canonical state, found None.
  - START-HERE.md post_pivot_verification_passed drift: expected 'false' from canonical state, found None.
  - START-HERE.md repair_follow_on_outcome drift: expected 'managed_blocked' from canonical state, found None.
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

### WFLOW008

- finding_id: WFLOW008
- summary: Post-repair process verification is still pending, but the restart surfaces or legal next move contradict the canonical workflow state.
- severity: warning
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: .opencode/state/workflow-state.json, tickets/manifest.json, START-HERE.md, .opencode/state/latest-handoff.md, .opencode/tools/ticket_lookup.ts, .opencode/tools/ticket_update.ts, .opencode/plugins/stage-gate-enforcer.ts
- observed_or_reproduced: The workflow contract changed, but the repo is still hiding, overstating, or deadlocking the pending backlog-verification state. That lets restart surfaces imply readiness before historical trust is restored, or leaves the workflow flag stranded after the affected done-ticket set is already empty.
- evidence:
  - START-HERE.md does not show pending_process_verification = true while canonical workflow state does.
  - .opencode/state/latest-handoff.md does not show pending_process_verification = true while canonical workflow state does.
  - .opencode/state/workflow-state.json records pending_process_verification = true.
  - Current process window started at: 2026-04-07T22:18:12.264Z
  - Affected done tickets: none; the workflow flag should now be directly clearable.
- remaining_verification_gap: None recorded beyond the validated finding scope.

## Code Quality Findings

### EXEC001

- finding_id: EXEC001
- summary: One or more Python packages fail to import — the service cannot start.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: /home/pc/projects/GPTTalker/src
- observed_or_reproduced: Runtime errors (NameError, FastAPIError, missing dependency, broken DI pattern, etc.) that are invisible to static analysis prevent module load. Common causes: TYPE_CHECKING-guarded names used in runtime annotations, FastAPI dependency functions with non-Pydantic parameter types, circular imports.
- evidence:
  - src.hub: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic'
  - src.node_agent: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uvicorn'
  - src.shared: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic'

### REF-003

- finding_id: REF-003
- summary: Source imports reference missing local modules.
- severity: HIGH
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/index.ts
- observed_or_reproduced: At least one local import or require path no longer resolves to a file in the repo, so the runtime graph is internally inconsistent.
- evidence:
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/index.ts -> ./v4/classic/external.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/index.ts -> ./v4/classic/external.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/index.ts -> ./external.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/index.ts -> ./external.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/errors.ts -> ./ZodError.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/errors.ts -> ./locales/en.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/ZodError.ts -> ./helpers/typeAliases.js
  - .opencode/node_modules/zod/src/v3/ZodError.ts -> ./helpers/util.js

## Verification Gaps

- The diagnosis pack validates the concrete failures above. It does not claim broader runtime-path coverage than the current audit and supporting evidence actually exercised.
