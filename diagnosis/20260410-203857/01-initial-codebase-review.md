## Code Quality Findings

### EXEC-REMED-001

- finding_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- summary: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/reviews/remed-001-review-backlog-verification.md
- observed_or_reproduced: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- evidence:
  - ticket REMED-001 carries finding_source `EXEC-REMED-001`
  - review artifact: .opencode/state/reviews/remed-001-review-backlog-verification.md
  - missing exact command record
  - missing raw command output section with non-empty code block
  - missing explicit post-fix PASS/FAIL result

### EXEC-REMED-001

- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/reviews/fix-020-review-ticket-reconciliation.md
- observed_or_reproduced: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- evidence:
  - ticket FIX-020 carries finding_source `code-review`
  - review artifact: .opencode/state/reviews/fix-020-review-ticket-reconciliation.md
  - missing exact command record
  - missing raw command output section with non-empty code block

### EXEC-REMED-001

- finding_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- summary: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/reviews/remed-003-review-ticket-reconciliation.md
- observed_or_reproduced: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- evidence:
  - ticket REMED-003 carries finding_source `EXEC-REMED-001`
  - review artifact: .opencode/state/reviews/remed-003-review-ticket-reconciliation.md
  - missing exact command record

### EXEC-REMED-001

- finding_id: EXEC-REMED-001
- summary: Remediation review artifact does not contain runnable command evidence.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: tickets/manifest.json, .opencode/state/reviews/remed-004-review-ticket-reconciliation.md
- observed_or_reproduced: A ticket created from a validated finding is being reviewed on prose alone, so the audit cannot confirm that the original failing command or canonical acceptance command was actually rerun after the fix.
- evidence:
  - ticket REMED-004 carries finding_source `EXEC-REMED-001`
  - review artifact: .opencode/state/reviews/remed-004-review-ticket-reconciliation.md
  - missing exact command record
  - missing raw command output section with non-empty code block
  - missing explicit post-fix PASS/FAIL result

### EXEC001

- finding_id: EXEC001
- summary: One or more Python packages fail to import — the service cannot start.
- severity: CRITICAL
- evidence_grade: repo-state validation
- affected_files_or_surfaces: /tmp/scafforge-repair-candidate-h82mgp4g/candidate/src
- observed_or_reproduced: Runtime errors (NameError, FastAPIError, missing dependency, broken DI pattern, etc.) that are invisible to static analysis prevent module load. Common causes: TYPE_CHECKING-guarded names used in runtime annotations, FastAPI dependency functions with non-Pydantic parameter types, circular imports.
- evidence:
  - src.hub: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiosqlite'
  - src.node_agent: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'
  - src.shared: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiosqlite'

## Verification Gaps

- The diagnosis pack validates the concrete failures above. It does not claim broader runtime-path coverage than the current audit and supporting evidence actually exercised.
